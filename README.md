# Portfolio

My task was to create a portfolio with responsive styling using CSS. This project includes:

- Navigation links that scroll to the different content on the same page.

- An about me section with a picture, describing my coding journey.
- Background images for my work portfolio boxes.
- When you click on the box for the main work project it goes to the deployed application.
- When you resize the page it adjusts for device viewers.
- The footer contains another navigation bar with interactive links.
- When you click on my email it opens an email client.
- When you click on my Github it goes to that website in another tab window.

* The four smaller boxes have a placeholder image, titled Future Projects. You can hover and click but they do not have deployed applications yet.
